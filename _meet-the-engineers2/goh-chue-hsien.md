<strong>Goh Chue Hsien</strong>
<br> Defence Engineer
<br> Defence Science and Technology Agency

### How are you transforming the future as an engineer?
I work with a multi-disciplinary team of defence engineers to enable the digitalization of the Ministry of Defence and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), towards the goal of improving work processes. An example is a project involving Augmented Reality (AR) technology in which AR glasses are used to improve maintenance work onboard Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) ships, by augmenting maintenance procedures and providing timely safety reminders throughout the work processes. Through close collaboration with RSN personnel, we were able to rapidly design and deliver a technology prototype for the ship crew to trial with.

### Who will benefit from your project?
Offshore RSN maintenance crew on board ships can get assistance and guidance during the maintenance process via a pair of AR glasses, which show detailed instructions and animations of maintenance procedures. This project aims to improve maintenance operations, reduce errors and equipment downtime.

### What is the best part about engineering?
As an engineer, I get to explore and work with the latest technologies. I find it challenging and meaningful to be able to use technology to bring about transformation to our nation. I hope that the work I do benefits the SAF by helping them embrace technology to punch above its weight, and in turn, contribute to national defence.

### Why do you choose to be a Public Service engineer?
In the Public Service, I am able to contribute to nation building in ways that I am confident in and through work that I enjoy doing. As I pursue my interest in engineering, I get to push technological frontiers and make a difference to the defence and security of our nation.

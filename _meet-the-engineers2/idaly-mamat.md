<br> Principal Engineer
<br> Public Utilities Board

### How are you transforming the future as an engineer?
Managing stormwater runoff in urban Singapore is challenging due to land
constraints. We need creative solutions in planning for our drainage systems
taking into account future developments. As I am in the Drainage Planning team
of PUBâ€™s Catchment &amp; Waterway Department, my work involves safeguarding
the drainage infrastructure by ensuring that the drainage schemes are effective.
We constantly review and improve the drainage systems, identify, manage and
reduce flood risks in the more flood-prone areas.

### Who will benefit from your project?
Flooding in an urbanised city like Singapore can be disruptive. By enhancing the
flood resilience of vulnerable areas, we help to reduce the risk of flooding and
minimise the disruptions to the lives of our fellow Singaporeans.

### What is the best part about engineering?
I love applying what I have learnt in an environment that allows and encourages
innovation and the breaking of boundaries. There is always much to learn from
and be inspired by in engineering. Whether it is to explore the feasibility of a
new technology or scale up and implement the new technology, I find
excitement in every project.

### Why do you choose to be a Public Service engineer?
I enjoy being involved in the behind-the-scene works that keep our nation
ticking. I am happy to be able to contribute meaningfully in ensuring that our city
continues to function like clockwork.

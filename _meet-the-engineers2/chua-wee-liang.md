### How are you transforming the future as an engineer?
I am currently involved in the building of Singapore’s first high-rise, multi-tenanted, indoor logistics facility that houses inland container depots, warehouses and a heavy vehicle park. This next-generation facility at Gul Circle also pioneers the implementation of Integrated Digital Delivery where digital technologies integrate work processes and connect relevant project stakeholders throughout the construction and building life cycle. We employ the use of virtual reality, photogrammetry and drones to improve construction efficiency, safety and sustainability. Ultimately, this allows the team to perform data-driven decision making at the design, construction and operation stages of a building’s life cycle and deliver smarter buildings.

### Who will benefit from your project?
JTC Logistics Hub @ Gul represents the Government’s efforts in creating an innovative and sustainable infrastructure solution for the logistics industry. It also ensures a safer operating environment for workers and enables all-weather operations. With activities now clustered within a single development, land productivity is increased. Travelling time between heavy vehicle parks and warehouses is also reduced. This enhances operational efficiency and productivity as a whole and benefits companies throughout the entire value-chain.

### What is the best part about engineering?
I enjoy problem solving and engineering is all about that. I often challenge myself to find the best solutions to problems. It gives me great satisfaction as I apply my knowledge and experience gained to create more value for future projects.

### Why do you choose to be a Public Service engineer?
Engineering is the fundamental building block of all advancements, shaping society and our environment. I feel a sense of achievement knowing that my contribution will positively impact people’s lives by making a difference in the design and building of their workplaces

<strong>Hoon Ding Yi</strong>
<br> Software Engineer
<br> Government Technology Agency

### How are you transforming the future as an engineer?
I am a software engineer in a team that builds software applications for citizens. We recently launched the Moments of Life (Families) app where we built integrated services from four government agencies (MSF, ECDA, ICA, HPB) into a single app. This app provides useful services and information needed by parents and caregivers of young children on a single digital platform. Users can register a new birth, apply for Baby Bonus, search for nearby pre-schools, access a childâ€™s health records and view upcoming events through this app.

### Who will benefit from your project?
Families with children from newborns to age 6 can now save time and hassle in retrieving credible and quality information through this digital platform. They can now transact with the government easily and at their own time and convenience.

### What is the best part about engineering?
As a software engineer, the work is rarely repetitive or boring. There is always something new to learn and this perpetual learning opportunity gives me a great sense of fulfilment every day. Being able to work collaboratively with other team members to achieve our goals also makes the job very satisfying.

### Why do you choose to be a Public Service engineer?
I find it very meaningful to be able to build digital products that will benefit the entire nation. In the Public Service, there are also many exciting opportunities where new technologies, such as blockchain, can also be applied.

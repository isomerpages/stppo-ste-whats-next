### How are you transforming the future as an engineer?How are you transforming the future as an engineer?
My team builds machine learning models and deploys them as tech products such as micro services and web applications. We would first talk to our users to understand their needs. We then develop prototypes and with regular feedback from our users, improve on them until we finally develop something that is directly beneficial and valuable.

### What is the best part about engineering?
I appreciate the fact that there will always be something interesting and worth experimenting in, in the field of engineering. What I enjoy most is to be able to take an idea and build it into a beneficial product. On top of that, with the proliferation of technology, any technological product can be easily accessed and used by millions of people. This allows me to be able to make a positive impact on a large scale.

### Why do you choose to be a Public Service engineer?
Being in the Public Service allows me to make the strongest and most direct positive impact on society. As a Data Science Engineer for instance, I am able to create a web application to help LTA bus planners optimise the bus network that ultimately benefits all bus commuters.

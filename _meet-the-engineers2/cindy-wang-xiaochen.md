### How are you transforming the future as an engineer?
I am involved in the Smart Hub project in HDB. Data received from sensors that are embedded within our HDB estates are collected and integrated into the Smart Hub to generate real-time relevant insights. With this wealth of information, we will be able to work with our stakeholders such as the Town Councils to better monitor and analyse the performance of key estate services, such as lighting, pumps and waste collection, to optimise maintenance cycles and minimise service disruptions.

### Who will benefit from your project?
Data collected by the Smart Hub can transform the way HDB towns are planned, designed and maintained to provide a better living environment for HDB residents. The innovative technology allows identification of patterns and predictive analysis of systems, enabling a better response to residentsâ€™ needs.

### What is the best part about engineering?
Nothing is impossible in engineering. Even if it seems so now, it is heartening to know that engineers are constantly in the process of finding answers. As an engineer, I help to solve problems and improve lives. This keeps me going every day.

### Why do you choose to be a Public Service engineer?
Being a Public Service engineer means my work will help improve the lives of our fellow citizens. To me, this is the best way I can serve my country.

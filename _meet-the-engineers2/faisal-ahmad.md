<br> Senior Engineer
<br> Public Utilities Board

### How are you transforming the future as an engineer?
PUB manages our water cycle - from the collection, purification and supply of drinking water to the treatment of used water and its reclamation into NEWater as well as the drainage of stormwater.

PUB also partners with the private sector to deliver water solutions via Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) projects. The private sector designs, builds, owns and operates the water plant while PUB acquires water services cost effectively. I am part of the PPP team and we manage the contracts and operations of desalination plants to ensure a reliable supply of desalinated water that meets PUB’s specifications and Singapore’s required quantity.

### Who will benefit from your project?
PPP projects offer growth opportunities for the private sector to gain relevant experience and build track records. It also encourages the private companies to bring forth their latest technologies and helps to ensure that Singapore will enjoy water supply at the best value.

### What is the best part about engineering?
Engineering is multi-disciplinary, complex and challenging. There will always be fresh challenges and prospects that will keep our work interesting and exciting. We can always rely on engineering principles to come up with solutions, recognising that engineering also makes our lives better by enabling us to improve the performance, efficiency and reliability of our public infrastructure.

### Why do you choose to be a Public Service Engineer?
I find it meaningful and fulfilling to know that what I have accomplished contributes towards a resilient system and the delivery of a robust, clean, safe and sustainable water supply, not just for ourselves but also for our future generations.

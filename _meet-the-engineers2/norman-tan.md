<strong> Norman Tan</strong>
<br> Civil Engineer

### How are you engineering what’s next?
I am part of the team overseeing and managing the Tuas Terminal Phase 2 reclamation project. Specifically, I am managing the environmental aspect of this project, which is known as the Environmental Management and Monitoring Programme (EMMP). The EMMP ensures that our future port is being built in a sustainable manner that protects our precious marine environment.

### What are some challenges you face in your project?
The development of Tuas Port is an immensely complex project comprising numerous interconnected sub-sections, each with its own unique set of challenges and problems. As the problems faced are often inter-disciplinary in nature (i.e geotechnical, environmental, project management), we must be able to draw ideas and options from multiple perspectives and synthesize solutions, while bearing cost, quality and time in mind. Further to the application of engineering knowledge, we would be exposed to various areas such as financial budgeting, cost reviewing and even tender evaluation. It’s a job that requires us to be flexible and versatile!

### What is the best part about engineering?
Every engineering project has its own unique set of challenges. What I like the most is how we adopt and apply a structured and methodological approach towards solving technical challenges. In doing so, we are able to overcome engineering challenges to ensure our project runs smoothly and is completed on time. Hence, it gives me a great sense of achievement to see my project being realised.

### Why do you choose to be a Public Service Engineer?
Being involved in the Tuas Port project is a once in a lifetime opportunity and it gives me great satisfaction to see the port slowly being realised in front of me every day. This adds extra meaning to the work that I do, knowing that I am directly contributing to Singapore’s future.

<strong>Chen Juncheng</strong>
<br> Defence Engineer
<br> Defence Science and Technology Agency

### How are you transforming the future as an engineer?
I develop innovative technological solutions for the Ministry of Defence and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) by applying data analytics and machine learning. Currently, my team is working on the development of the Fleet Management System that enhances the maintenance and operations of assets for the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF). We develop predictive analytic models that monitor aircraft systems for unusual behaviour and diagnose impending failures for early rectification. In short, we use data to transform the way RSAF manages its aircraft fleet.

### Who will benefit from your project?
With predictive analytics, insights gained from aircraft health data will allow early detection of impending failures, leading to more efficient allocation of resources and manpower in the SAF. The new capabilities and technologies developed will also ensure that we maintain our operational edge.

### What is the best part about engineering?
Being at the forefront of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the field of data analytics constantly challenges me to exercise creativity. It is immeasurably satisfying to be able to apply technical knowledge and create new solutions that could solve real-world problems and revolutionise our daily lives.

### Why do you choose to be a Public Service engineer?
As a Defence Engineer in the Public Service, I have the opportunity to innovate and work with cutting-edge technology to contribute to the defence and security of our nation.

I also get to mentor aspiring engineers through DSTA's outreach initiatives such as the Young Defence Scientists Programme and have the opportunity to introduce engineering concepts and applications to them.

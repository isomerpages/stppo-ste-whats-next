## SAVING LIVES WITH A TOUCH

A few seconds could make all the difference, and the quick touch of an app and response of people nearby could save a cardiac 
arrest victim’s life. Singapore Civil Defence Force together with GovTech have made this a reality with myResponder
, a free smartphone application designed for citizens to report and respond to cases of cardiac arrest.

### A LIFE-SAVING APP
The early application of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and public Automatic External Defibrillators (AEDs) 
have proven to be the two most effective means of raising survival rates in public.

With the myResponder app, Community First Responders can be notified to locate the nearest AEDs and perform CPR on cardiac
arrest victims who are within their immediate vicinity – thus enabling the community to contribute to saving lives.

As Singapore has one of the highest smartphone market penetration rates in the world, an app with a Global Position System (GPS)
and a pool of Community First Responders, can be incredibly impactful to the survival of cardiac arrest victims in public settings.

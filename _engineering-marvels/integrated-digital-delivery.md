## DIGITALISATION IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
Integrated Digital Delivery (IDD) refers to the use of digital technologies throughout the four stages of the built environment life cycle – Design, Fabrication, Construction and Asset Delivery & Management. It builds upon Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) to better integrate work processes and stakeholders across the whole value chain.

### LOGISTICS HUB @ GUL CIRCLE
One such project that uses IDD is the JTC Logistics Hub @ Gul. Targeted to be completed in mid-2020, this will be Singapore’s first high-rise multi-tenant facility co-locating Inland Container Deports (ICDs), warehouses and a heavy vehicle park. The new integrated development is set to improve operational efficiency and productivity for logistics companies, thereby catalysing the growth and transformation of the logistics industry

### SPEAR-HEADING DIGITALISATION EFFORTS
Some of the digitalised processes that JTC has implemented are:

#### Defect Management System - 
This system allows for real-time reporting, tracking and follow-up of defects at the construction site. In addition, it allows quality-related issues to be addressed in a timely and systematic manner. Builders can also easily generate statistics for analysis and planning purposes.

#### Safety Management System - 
This digital and mobile-based safety reporting system enables real-time reporting, tracking and follow-up of safety issues at the construction site. The dashboard also summarises all the safety observations for trend analysis and hence, allows targeted remedial action to be carried out on problem areas.

#### BIM-based Digital Logistics Management -
Together with the Nanyang Technological University, JTC has developed an integrated digital logistics system that leverages BIM. Adopted in collaboration with Kimly Construction, this solution facilitates a seamless logistics process – from the prefabrication plant to construction site – while enabling greater precision during construction

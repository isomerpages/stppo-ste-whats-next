## WORLD'S FIRST HIGH RISE ROTATABLE LAB FOR THE TROPICS

BCA SkyLab is a state-of-the-art test-bed for energy-efficient technologies in facades, air-conditioning, lighting and controls. A rotatable outdoor facility atop a 7-storey building with a 360-degree movable platform, it rotates to ‘chase’ the sun or turn to the wind to harness the weather so as to bring about the best in green technology. It conducts tests under “real-world” conditions at any desired building orientation. The facility aims to test-bed technologies that will bring Singapore closer to constructing buildings that will produce more energy than they consume such as harnessing solar energy, reducing energy consumption by using more efficient air-conditioning or lighting systems.

The BCA SkyLab serves as a key infrastructure for the built environment industry and research community in co-innovating green building technologies.

The BCA SkyLab has been accorded the IES Prestigious Engineering Achievement Awards 2017 at the World Engineers Summit Conference.

The SkyLab has several unique features:

- Plug and Play concept for easy reconfiguration of lighting, air-conditioning, façade, sensors & controls for effective evaluation of innovative technologies. This allows the testing of energy-efficient technologies, individually or as an integrated system in real-world conditions. 

- Rotational capability that enables testing of technologies in any building orientation of interest thereby eliminating the need for multiple stationary labs facing different directions

- “Real world” outdoor testbed that allows technologies to be tested under actual weather conditions.

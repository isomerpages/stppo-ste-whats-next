## CONNECTING PARENTS & SCHOOLS ANYTIME

Parents Gateway is a digital service that connects parents and schools on key administrative matters. It eliminates hardcopy forms and letters from the schools’ administrative process. Available on IOS and Android mobile devices, it is a one-stop mobile app that centralises information so that parents can access them on all their children in one place. This enables parents and schools to better support their children’s educational journey. Schools can send information and updates on programmes and activities to parents including videos and photographs of their learning children. Parents, with a click of a button, can perform administrative functions such as consenting their children to participate in school activities. More functions will be added gradually to Parents Gateway to better serve the needs of teachers, parents and students.

### THE DESIGN PRINCIPALS

Parents Gateway is created out of a desire to reduce the educator’s administrative load as well as bringing greater convenience to parents. Through digitalization, engineers successfully brought forth digital solutions that centralize information so that parents can access them conveniently and instantly simply by tapping on their mobile phones.
 
The design principles of Parents Gateway rely heavily on the adoption of Design Thinking to design, implement and test the product. It is one of the large-scale government products developed in-house and deployed, via infrastructure as a code, on an Open Source Public Cloud environment leveraging the power of Cloud’s scalability and robustness.  

Parents Gateway is also one of the few government products engineered using Agile Software Development Methodology and deployed using a suite of DevOps tools to support continuous integration and delivery.

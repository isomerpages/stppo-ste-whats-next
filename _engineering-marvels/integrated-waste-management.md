## WASTE NOT
The Integrated Waste Management Facility (IWMF) is an iconic flagship project in the arena of solid waste treatment, with emphasis on high-efficiency green technologies and robust designs to help to meet Singapore’s future waste disposal needs. The land footprint will be optimised through the innovative use of design layouts as well as selection of land use efficient technologies. To harness the potential synergies of the water-energy-waste nexus and to achieve greater environment sustainability, the IWMF will be co-located with Public Utilities Board’s Tuas Water Reclamation Plant (TWRP) and is slated for completion in 2024.

### OPTIMISING LAND FOOTPRINT
The IWMF will be providing Singapore with several key solid waste treatment processes in an integrated facility to effectively handle multiple waste streams namely:

- Municipal Solid Waste (MSW);
- Source Segregated Food Waste (SSFW);
- Source Segregated Recyclables (SSRW) from National Recycling Programme (NRP); and
- Digested sludge from the co-located TWRP.

The land footprint will be optimised through the innovative use of design layouts as well as selection of land use efficient technologies. With the coupling of IWMF and TWRP, the following key process synergies could be achieved:

- Co-digestion of Source Segregated Food Waste with used-water sludge for higher biogas production;
- Use of biogas to increase electricity generation at IWMF and the supply of a part of the electricity generated for the operation   of TWRP;
- Incinerate the digestate from TWRP at IWMF and the waste heat recovered for electricity generation; and
- Effluent water from TWRP will be used as cooling water for IWMF which will help to enhance the overall energy efficiency of IWMF

## A NEW WAY TO WORK, LEARN AND PLAY
The first district in Singapore to adopt an integrated masterplan approach, PDD is a multi-agency collaboration project between Infocomm Media Development Authority, JTC, Singapore Institute of Technology and Urban Redevelopment Authority.

### FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND INTEGRATED MASTERPLANNING
In contrast to existing business parks and large-scale districts where physical infrastructure, urban solutions and digital infrastructure are developed in silos, PDD will see the full integration of digital infrastructure from the ground up, in tandem with the physical planning and development of the District. The Open Digital Platform will integrate various smart city solutions such as facilities, building and estate management systems, district cooling system, pneumatic waste conveyancing system, autonomous goods delivery systems, access and security systems,carparks system, traffic lights system, and autonomous vehicles in PDD.

### OPEN DATA FOR CROWDSOURCING SOLUTIONS
To encourage academics, researchers, startups and small &amp; medium enterprises (SMEs) to create solutions, data on the Open Digital Platform will also be made available for them to develop digital or urban solutions for PDD.Real-time and historical data from estate and building management systems will be published via an Application Programming Interface (API), on which the community is able to access information to develop digital applications or urban solutions in PDD. These data can potentially range from utilisation of facilities, electricity consumption to even equipment breakdown information from estate and building management systems. A digital twin (digital replica) of the entire district will be made available for contributors to do safe testing of solutions before deploying them

Materials Engineers know deeply about the basic structure and properties of materials, and understand how different materials can be processed and modified to make the products of modern technology more durable, faster, lighter and better suited to human needs.

### HEREâ€™S WHAT TO EXPECT

Material Engineers are very versatile and find themselves in many different industries. They can be found developing nanomaterials for cancer treatment, biodegradable materials for biomedical devices, advanced functional materials for defence systems and sporting equipment and apparels, new eco-materials for our environment, nano-electronic materials for future IC chips, and many more.

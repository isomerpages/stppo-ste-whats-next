Saying the work of a Geotechnical Engineer requires in-depth expertise isn’t an overstatement. It takes you deep underground and into the earth. You will deal with infrastructural works such as tunnels, land reclamations, deep basement excavations, underground storage space, pile foundations, ground improvement, geosynthetics and other related works such as earth retaining structures and slope stabilisation.

### HERE’S WHAT TO EXPECT

At home or abroad, Geotechnical Engineers are in great demand. In Singapore, there’s the rapid development of MRT lines, underground expressways and deep sewerage tunnels networks. Around the surrounding region, high-speed railways, highways, earth dams and deep basement works are in the works. As a Geotechnical Engineer, you will find yourself involved in the analysis, design and construction of many underground and geotechnical infrastructures.

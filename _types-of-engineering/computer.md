Developing and improving both the software programmes and hardware that make computers run are primarily what a Computer Engineer does. You may choose between two areas of specialisation: software or hardware. Software Engineers transform hardware into fully functional computers with operating system software and computer programmes. Hardware Engineers develop the hardware of computers, including the motherboards, graphics and audio cards and drives that are later programmed by Software Engineers.

### HEREâ€™S WHAT TO EXPECT

Computer Engineers programme and maintain software tools, operating systems and hardware. When computer glitches occur, you will use your specialised knowledge of coding and computer frameworks to solve the problem. In order to keep up with the ever-changing tech world, you need to stay abreast of the latest trends and changes in software and hardware development. Familiarity with recently developed software programmes, patches and computer chips is essential.

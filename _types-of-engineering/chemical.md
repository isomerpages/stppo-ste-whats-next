Chemical Engineers are critical to the development of new technologies in robust and vibrant chemical and pharmaceutical industries. They use their knowledge of the physical world to manipulate the interactions of individual atoms and molecules, to create groundbreaking materials with atomic precision, so precise that humanity can build nano-scale car the width of a single DNA molecule.

### HEREâ€™S WHAT TO EXPECT

Chemical Engineers are highly sought after by global petrochemical giants. You can look forward to a wide range of career prospects in fields such as chemical, petroleum refining, petrochemical, semiconductor/electronic, bio/pharmaceutical industries. Careers within the military defence, working on explosives are also possibilities.
